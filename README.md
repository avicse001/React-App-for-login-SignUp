# 🔐 React Auth App – Signup & Login Flow

A modern authentication starter project built with **React**. This app demonstrates a full signup and login flow with validation, password visibility toggle, and a sleek **glassmorphism UI**. It uses **React Router** for navigation and **Local Storage** for persistence (no backend required).
